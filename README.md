# Patient Tracker App

Developed by THE SILICON SAVANTS, this application is designed for smaller medical entities in Western Massachusetts, designed to streamline the management of patient information and medical records. The primary goal is to provide doctors with a convenient and efficient way to access and update patient records during checkups. By digitizing the process, the application eliminates the need for manual paperwork and enhances the overall patient care experience. Manually transferring paperwork is slow and error prone. When it comes to medical issues, errors regarding prescriptions, and medical history can lead to dangerous misdiagnoses. Having a tested digitized patient tracking system, drastically reduces this risk of error. Furthermore, it reduces the workload of medical workers, allowing them to focus on more important work. Likewise, it allows users to easily check their appointments and to fill out forms, allowing them to best prepare for their upcoming appointment(s).
